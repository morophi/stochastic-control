# stochastic-control

This is not about making AI safer.  
It’s about making responsibility non-transferable.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is **not a software product**.  
It is **not a framework for automation**.  
It is **not a collection of best practices**.

This repository is a **controlled environment for responsibility-bound reasoning**  
in probabilistic systems, including LLM-based workflows.

It exists to define **where responsibility must stop moving**.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

If you are looking for:

- faster output
- better prompts
- productivity shortcuts
- AI-assisted decision making without accountability

You are in the wrong place.

This repository does not optimize results.  
It constrains delegation.

---

## Core Idea

Modern AI systems are probabilistic.  
Responsibility becomes ambiguous when outputs are plausible.

This repository proposes a simple constraint:

> Responsibility must never be transferable to the system.

No matter how capable the system appears,  
no matter how accurate the output looks,  
no matter how frequently the model is correct.

## How This Repository Is Used

This repository is used as:

- a thinking scaffold
- a responsibility boundary
- a verification surface for AI-assisted reasoning
- an educational testbed for LACP-based workflows

It is intentionally uncomfortable.

---

## Who This Is For

- engineers
- educators
- system designers
- researchers
- individuals working with high-stakes AI outputs

If you feel friction while reading this repository,  
that friction is the point.

## Structure

- `system_core.ko.md` — core rules and responsibility constraints
- `doc_cloner_revise.md` — operational usage guide
- `doc_cloner_domestic.md` — contextualized domestic explanation
- `LICENSE` / `NOTICE` — boundary declarations

---

## Final Note

This repository does not ask for agreement.  
It asks for ownership.

If this constraint feels unnecessary to you,  
this repository is not for you.
