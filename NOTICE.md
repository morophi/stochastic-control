# Notice on Interpretation and Responsibility

This repository defines a **boundary**, not a belief system.
It constrains interpretation, not agreement.

Before using, teaching, or referencing this framework,
read this notice carefully.

---

## 1. This Framework Does NOT Think for You

This framework does not:

- generate correct answers
- validate decisions
- replace human judgment
- assume user intent

AI outputs produced within this framework
are artifacts, not conclusions.

---

## 2. Responsibility Does Not Transfer

Using this framework does not:

- shift responsibility to AI
- shift responsibility to the author
- provide justification for outcomes
- dilute accountability through education or experimentation

Responsibility remains with the human operator.
Always.

---

## 3. On Partial Use and Extraction

This framework is not modular advice.

Extracting or quoting parts of:

- system_core documents
- execution rules
- declaration statements

without full context
will almost certainly lead to misinterpretation.

If the whole cannot be presented,
parts must not be presented.

---

## 4. On Translation and Explanation

Translations and summaries are **non-canonical**.

- The original English documents define the framework
- Local-language documents exist for explanation only

Any claim or critique must defer to the original source
when discrepancies arise.

---

## 5. On Disagreement

Disagreement with this framework is valid.

Rejection is valid.
Non-adoption is valid.

Misrepresentation is not.

Criticism is meaningful
only when the original structure is preserved.

---

## 6. Educational Context Clarification

Use in educational settings does not imply:

- reduced standards
- shared responsibility
- experimental exemption

Education here means **training responsibility**, not automating judgment.

---

## 7. Why This Notice Exists

Most misuse of AI does not come from malice,
but from blurred boundaries.

This notice exists to keep those boundaries visible.

If that feels uncomfortable,
it is functioning as intended.
