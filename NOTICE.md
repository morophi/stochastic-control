# Notice on Use and Interpretation

This repository defines a **boundary**, not a belief.

Before using or referencing this framework,
please read the following carefully.

---

## 1. This Framework Does NOT Think for You

This framework does not:

- generate correct answers
- validate decisions
- replace judgment
- assume intent

If you expect AI to decide, optimize, or approve,
this framework is not designed for that purpose.

---

## 2. Responsibility Does Not Transfer

Using this framework does not:

- shift responsibility to AI
- shift responsibility to the author
- provide justification for outcomes

All decisions, interpretations, and consequences
remain with the user.

Always.

---

## 3. On Partial Use and Quotation

This framework is **not modular advice**.

Extracting parts of:

- system_core.md
- execution rules
- declaration statements

without full context
will almost certainly lead to misinterpretation.

If you cannot present the whole,
do not present parts.

---

## 4. On Translation and Rewriting

Translations, summaries, and reinterpretations
introduce bias and distortion.

For this reason:

- The original English documents are the only canonical reference
- Local-language documents are explanatory guides only

Any claim based on translated or summarized text
must defer to the original source.

---

## 5. On Disagreement

Disagreement with this framework is valid.

Misrepresentation is not.

Criticism is welcome
**only when the original structure is preserved**.

---

## 6. Why This Notice Exists

Most misuse of AI does not come from malice,
but from blurred boundaries.

This notice exists to keep those boundaries visible.

If that feels uncomfortable,
it is functioning as intended.
