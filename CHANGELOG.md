# CHANGELOG

This changelog records **conceptual evolution**, not just textual edits.
Each version reflects a shift in responsibility framing and usage context.

## v0.2 — Responsibility Boundary Formalization

**Date:** 2025-12-28

### Why This Revision Exists

The repository evolved beyond its initial role as a system prompt or
efficiency-oriented AI usage guide.

During practical use and educational planning, a structural issue became clear:

> AI usage failures were not primarily technical.  
> They were failures of **responsibility placement**.

This revision formalizes that insight.

---

### What Changed Conceptually

#### 1. From Optimization to Constraint

- Earlier versions implicitly prioritized:
  - clarity
  - speed
  - output quality
- v0.2 explicitly rejects optimization as a goal.

The system now exists to **constrain delegation**, not to enhance performance.

---

#### 2. From Prompt to Constitution

- `system_core` shifted from:
  - engine configuration
  - behavior tuning
- to:
  - responsibility constitution
  - non-transferable accountability boundary

The document now functions as a **governing rule**, not an instruction set.

---

#### 3. Explicit Rejection of Responsibility Leakage

Repeated observation showed that responsibility leaks through:

- phrasing (“the AI decided…”)
- educational exemption (“this was just practice”)
- probabilistic confidence (“it was likely correct”)

v0.2 introduces explicit language to block these escape routes.

---

#### 4. Education Was Reclassified

Education was previously treated as a softer context.

This revision asserts:

- education does not reduce responsibility
- experimentation does not justify delegation
- failure remains owned by the human operator

Education is now defined as **responsibility training**, not automation training.

---

### Structural Changes

- `system_core.md` rewritten as a responsibility constitution
- `system_core.ko.md` aligned semantically, not translationally
- `LICENSE.md` clarified as _terms of use_, not open-source license
- `NOTICE.md` reframed as an interpretation charter
- Redundant or ambiguous authority cues removed

---

### What Did NOT Change

- The framework does not claim correctness
- The framework does not offer moral judgment
- The framework does not enforce adoption
- Disagreement remains valid

Only misrepresentation is rejected.

---

### Design Principle Reinforced

> If accepting an output is easier than explaining it,  
> the system has already failed.

This friction is intentional.
This friction is the point.

---

## v0.1 — Initial Declaration

**Date:** 2025-12-XX

- Initial system prompt and usage constraints
- Focused on output discipline and logical clarity
- Responsibility implications implicit, not formalized

This version established the foundation but did not yet name
responsibility as the central invariant.

---

## Future Revisions (Non-Committal)

Future changes, if any, will occur only if:

- responsibility boundaries are observed to erode
- educational misuse creates new ambiguity
- the framework is misread as a productivity tool

Feature additions are not planned.

The framework evolves only to protect its core constraint.
